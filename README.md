# Unluckiest Football Players Analysis (2024)

## Overview
This project identifies the **unluckiest football players** of the 2023/2024 season in the Premier League by analyzing the gap between their **expected goals (xG)** and **actual goals scored**. Using SQL and Tableau, I uncovered players who underperformed despite having high-quality chances.

## Key Insights
- **Dominic Calvert Lewin** had the worst luck score (-5.90), scoring only 7 goals from an xG of 12.9.
- **Liverpool** had 3 players in the top 10 unluckiest list, suggesting systemic issues.
- The average luck score across the league was -0.01, indicating a slight underperformance.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For data querying and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing the results.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the project.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset (`pl_player24.csv`).
